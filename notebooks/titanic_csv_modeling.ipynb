    "## Chapter 6: Building Logistic Regression from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "A Logistic Regression model is essentially a mathematical machine that takes in features (X), multiplies them by weights (W), adds a bias (b), and pushes the result through a \"Squashing Function\" to get a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Prediction (The Sigmoid Function)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Linear Regression, which can predict any number from negative to positive infinity, Logistic Regression must predict a probability between 0 and 1. We use the Sigmoid Function to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where  = X \\cdot W + b$. If $\\sigma(z)$ is 0.85, the model is 85% sure the passenger survived.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Penalty (Log Loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know if the model is doing a bad job? We use a Cost Function called Log Loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If the passenger survived (1) but the model predicted 0.01, the \"Penalty\" is very high.\n",
    "*   If the model predicted 0.99, the \"Penalty\" is near zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Teacher (Gradient Descent)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"learning\" part. The model calculates the slope (gradient) of the error and takes a small step in the opposite direction to reduce the penalty. It repeats this thousands of times until it finds the \"best\" weights for Pclass, Sex, and Age.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Initialize the Modeling Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In your new notebook, start by importing the clean data and setting up the mathematical foundations.\n"
